  <section id="mission">
  	<p>
  		We live in a culture that prioritizes profit over people and where cooking 
  		meals for ourselves on a regular basis takes tremendous effort - 
  		The Kale Emporium is a volunteer organization that responds to these issues 
  		with weekly donation-based community dinners.
  	</p>

  	<p>
  		We seek to expand access to local produce, offer nutrition education, facilitate 
  		self-study, host culinary skillshares, support farmers financially, reduce food 
  		waste, and care for others through our cooking and the sense of community 
  		that comes with it.
